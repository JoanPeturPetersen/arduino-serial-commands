arduino-serial-commands
=======================

Send simple commands to the arduino using the serial port.

This code can easily be extended to so that the Arduino can be used to
control devices using simple commands.

I'm planning to build a small ROV (remotely controlled vehicle), and
plan to control the engines this way, maybe using RS485 communication.
